This repository features all my configs for my usual IceWM setup

This is a string WIP since I've lost my old config to a bad flash drive.

## I've you found this repo by chance:

### What is IceWM?
IceWM is a pretty good window manager which is criminaly under used. You should try it too!

### I've got it, but what now?
* Start writing your configs in your `~/.icewm` folder. 
    * Especially useful is the startup file!
Start the `volumeicon` for volume shortcuts to work, or start a power-manager for brightness. Or use something like PCmanFM to provide features like desktop icons and a wallpaper. It really is up to you!
* Don't like how outdated it looks?
    * Go online and find a theme you like and put it in the `~.icewm/themes` folder.
* You almost like the theme you found, but something isn't quite right yet?
    * Don't worry you can take the choosen theme as a base and modify it!

### Okay... what now?
The best thing to do is to check out the documentation at: `https://ice-wm.org/manual/`

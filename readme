IceMatcha is a port of the Matcha theme for IceWM,these colors are available with their light and dark variants

Azul
Aliz
Sea

--------------instalation----------------

copy the folder on 

/usr/share/icewm/themes/

or in this another folder

/home/"username"/.icewm/themes/

these packages are not necessary for the operation of IceMint, but I recommend installing them:

matcha-gtk-theme
lxappearance(to set the Matcha GTK theme)

the installation of these packages may vary depending on your distribution
